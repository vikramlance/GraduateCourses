Data Visualization

Do Problem 3.3 (page 69) - Laptop Sales at a London Computer Chain.  A report needs to be written that contains answers to the two questions (a) and (b) given in the book plus the following –

3.3 Laptop Sales at a London Computer Chain: Bar Charts and Boxplots. The file LaptopSalesJanuary2008.xls contains data for all sales of laptops at a computer chain in London in January 2008. This is a subset of the full dataset that includes data for the entire year.
(a).   Create a bar chart, showing the average retail price by store. Which store has the highest average? Which has the lowest?
(b).   To better compare retail prices across stores, create side-by-side boxplots of retail price by store. Now compare the prices in the two stores above. Do you see a difference between their price distributions? Explain.

For all homework 
In case, you are using the web documents, articles or books, make sure to cite them in your paper.  If you are quoting or picking up a sentence or a paragraph from someone’s work, make sure to put that within quotes.  It is illegal and also unethical to plagiarize other people’s work.  I take a very deem view of this and if you get caught, you will be reported to the Dean’s Office and will get an automatic F in the course.
